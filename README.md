# ✍️ About
📏 A set of advanced compositional layouts for `UICollectionView` with examples [Swift 5.2, iOS 13]. All the layouts support both `portrait` and `landscape` orientations as well as support for all `iOS` and `iPadOS` related size classes.

# 🏗 Setup
There are no dependencies as well as any package managers involved. The project has more like a demo app setup e.g simply grab what you need for your needs. Each layout is wrapped into a separate `UIViewController` type for convenience (I could've create a separate layout factory and have just a single view controller, however, for the sake of simplicity I decided to make it possible to extract layouts with all the dependent code).

# ✈️ Usage
Simply grab a `UIViewController` type with a custom layout and adjust it for your needs. The layouts are in [here](https://github.com/jVirus/compositional-layouts-kit/tree/master/compositional-layouts-kit/Compositional%20Layouts%20VCs).

# 🆘 Tips
1. Not all layouts may look cool in landscape orientations. In order to make them look cooler and take advantage of different aspect ratio of a screen, you need to create an alternative layout that is basically the copy of the portrait layout, but has different set of fractional width and height.
2. If you want to have different layouts in portrait and landscape device orientations, you need to use either one of the following approaches:
   - Use `viewWillTransition(to size: , with coordinator:)` method (of `UIViewController` class) and `setCollectionViewLayout(, animated: completion:)` method of `UICollectionView` class to properly animate changes of layout when changing orientation.
   - More advanced and preffered approach is to implement a custom `UICollectionViewTransitionLayout`, which is (a quote from `Apple's Docs`):
   > A special type of layout object that lets you implement behaviors when changing from one layout to another in your collection view.
